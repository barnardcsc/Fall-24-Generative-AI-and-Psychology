# Fall-24-Generative-AI-and-Psychology

This workshop is taught by Sowon Hahn (Department of Psychology, Seoul National University), Yoon Kyung Lee (Ph.D., Postdoc at Institute of Psychological Sciences, Seoul National University), and Da Yeong Yoon (Visual Artist, Director at Sanxoro Art Studio). 

This workshop is designed to transform your ideas into mobile app prototypesâ€”no prior coding experience required. Discover how to seamlessly integrate AI-generated images into your designs and gain practical experience with AI prompts through hands-on sessions. You will learn how to adjust large language model prompts to meet your expectations as a user, and we will discuss how to align prompts that accurately portray aesthetics and emotions. Next, using Figma's intuitive visual tools, you'll explore the power of AI technologies to create digital artwork, illustrations, and more. This workshop offers a unique opportunity to collaborate with AI, turning your creative vision into impactful, real-world applications.
